    <p>“If you're lucky or connected, you can get an invite sans the price tag. But I wasn't so lucky or
      connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are the most
      important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying
      about blowing your cash the whole time you won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and
      times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get
      excited!”</p>

  <p>“Always be true to your own sense of
    style, if you dont youll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is
    about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their
    new lines. Also its important to wear shoes youll be comfortable in all day. Obviously, you want to
    look good, but youll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.”</p>
